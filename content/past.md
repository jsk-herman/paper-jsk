## The Year 2022

## The Year 2021

### June

`2021-06-21`: I am learning the ins and outs of being a Vice President for Internal Affairs in my university's student organization for the Chemical Engineering department: [Philippine Institute of Chemical Engineering - Junior Chapter V (PIChE-JCV)](https://www.facebook.com/PIChEJCV/).

`2021-06-26`: I am developing this website and the [other site](https://notes.jskherman.com) for my notes. I have been learning a lot about the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/) and the world of [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) on the side, little by little, throughout last year.
