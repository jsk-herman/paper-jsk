## Double-Entry Bookkeeping

### What is Double-Entry Bookkeeping?

On a tangent, it is interesting to note that there are some similarities with _double-entry bookkeeping_ and _chemical engineering balances_ (i.e. mass, energy, and momentum balances). In a way, money could also be modelled as a property of the system and its flow modelled as going through unit operations. It would be interesting to see if something like income could be thought of as feed in a system and is transformed into other things of value by supposed unit operations. What those unit operations would be, I have no idea right now.

Some additional resources:

* Check out the video [“Double Entry Bookkeeping for Personal Finance” by Tea Leaves](https://youtu.be/lIGJzQw79hg). It gives a clear and concise introduction to the topic.
